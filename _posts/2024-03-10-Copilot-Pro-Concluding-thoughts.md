### Conclusion

If your generative AI needs are related to your work in an organisation, then Copilot for Microsoft 365 is aimed at you. It’s also the most expensive option here (although the work orientated version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise is also expensive).

If you are paying for ChatGPT Plus and you are not using it in an organisational setting, and especially if you are using office applications like Word and Excel then Copilot Pro has more features for the same money, and would be my favoured choice. The style and output of ChatGPT Plus compared to Copilot Pro is often different for the same prompts, and which is better for a given use case is a matter of personal taste. I find myself trying both and comparing. I note that ChatGPT tends to like making lists, whereas Copilot Pro tends toward prose.

If you aren’t using generative AI to create content Microsoft 365 applications like Word, or if there’s a particular plugin that ChatGPT Plus has that’s essential you your workflow, then ChatGPT may suit you better.

If you are using ChatGPT Plus for work, that’s a whole different discussion around the data you are putting into the model, and who you are sharing that data with and what policies your organisation may have around this.
