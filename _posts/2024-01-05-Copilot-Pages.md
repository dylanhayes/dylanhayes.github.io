title: Copilot Pages - Adding Charts
---

Copilot Pages are a feature of Biz chat allowing a more interactive approach to AI assisted authoring. Although broadly similar to Canvas in Chat GPT-4o, Copilot pages have some interesting features for mixing different types content due the incorporation of Loop capabilities.

## Starting with a prompt ##

please create an article about the elves of middle earth. include an org chart using mermaid in the article showing the principle elves of middle earth

## Looking at the output ##

The output of our prompt is displayed as the results.  As expected, an AI generated article has been output.

## Chart ##

If we scroll down, we can see some markdown has been inserted into the text. It took me a few interations to get the right prompt, as my first few attempts ended up with a designer image of mermaids, and charts. Eventually, I got chat to create output in Markdown, with additional instructions in Markdown to render a chart in Mermaid. There are lots of tools which can render Mermaid, and plugins for ChatGPT, but here we're going to keep this all "inhouse" and display the chart inline in our output.

## Edit in Pages ##

If we scroll to the bottom of the output, we can see "Edit in Pages". If we hit this button, the magic happens. If we scroll down we can see that the chart is now rendered from the Markdown. We can keep editing in chat, and inject additional prompts to change the text. 

## Add finese ##
We can make use of the edit features to move text around and add some semantic meaning. 

## Opening in Loop ##

If we are done with the AI led authoring experience, we can hit the little icon to open this in Loop, and have the same editing tools, but with more screen real estate given over to the editing expeience, by removing the prompt. We still have the ability to select text, and get Copilot to rewrite a section, but this is better for smaller tweaks to a document you are mostly done editing with, and may just need to tweak and revise a little bit. 

 The capabilities of Loop are worth a separate post, so I'll not go into any more detail at this point..
