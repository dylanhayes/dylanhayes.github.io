title: Booking in Outlook part II
---

Last time we talked about a simple way to answer the question "What time shall we meet?"

## This time we're taking a look at Microsoft Bookings##

There are 3rd party services out there which can do this for you, but it turns out Microsoft 365 can do this for you already as part of your existing license. In fact, as is often the case, there's actually two ways to do this. Each of these is optimised towards a slightly different use case but broadly do the same thing.

### Microsoft Bookings ###

This has been around for longer than [Book Time With Me](bookingtime), and although these both superfically do the same thing, this is aimed at more complex scenarios. 
I still use this as my primary tool for allowing others  to book meetings with myself, as I was using this before Book Time with Me came along,  but the intended use case for this is when you want to be able to book from a pool of people, customise the experience, or use this to trigger other actions. 

#### Getting Started ####

If you go to [https://outlook.office.com/bookings/](https://outlook.office.com/bookings/) you you get get started with Bookings.

Just like [Book time with Me](../bookingtime/) you can use this to setup a booking page for just yourself, but you can also set up.

A default private meeting is created to get you started. You can add your own additional meetings afterwards to suit your needs, so that you can offer different types of meeting by duration and purpose.


The second mistake is to not define your available hours correctly. By default, Exchange considers your day to start at 8 and end at 5. If you don't work those hours, somebody might book time with you outside your working day. Just head to [workSchedule](https://outlook.office.com/mail/options/calendar/workSchedule) to configure this to your needs. 

#### Fine tuning ####



### OK - Which tool should I use? ###

It depends on what you exact needs are. Generally, if you don't know, you probably should choose Book Time with Me.
