title: NE Bytes - SharePoint Hubsites Deep Dive
---

## Introduction

I talked at the excellent and friendly [NE Bytes](http://www.nebytes.net/) Usergroup in Newcastle, with a talk on 'SharePoint Hubsites Deep Dive'. It's the same talk that I did at the Yorkshire Office 365 Usergroup in September, but updated to reflect the dizzying speed of changes in SharePoint online. It's interesting to note the talk was orginally planned for early summer, but clashed with the world cup, then was run in September, and eventually Janurary 2019. Each time I had to go back and revise stuff as limits had been raised and new features added.

Here's the slide deck from my talk:
